I'm developing an employee management system using the MERN stack. The project allows CRUD operations for employee details, job categories, and professions. Features include user signup, login, forgot password with email verification, OTP verification, password reset, change password, and logout functionality.

Express - Node.js framework for better performence,
MongoDB - use for Data store,
Mongoose - use for connectivity between ExpressApp and MongoDB Database,
bcrypt - se for Password Security,
Multer - se for File handling,
JsonWebToken - use for Create a Token, Verify Token, Authentication, Authorisation and 
security 
Cors - Port cross verify like a Frontend and Backend work as same port so that not work and this problem handle by cors. Work in same port then cors change a port for error handling,
Nodemailer - use for send E-Mail to Reciever,


start with :- npm start
